#IUST HTMLCharDet

IUST HTMLCharDet is a java tool for detecting *charset encoding* of HTML web pages. **HTMLCharDet** stands for _**HTML** **Char**set **Dete**ctor_ and **IUST** stands for _**I**ran **U**niversity of **S**cience & **T**echnology_.

This tool is in connection with a paper entitled:  
<p align=center style="font-size:160%;">
 <b>Charset Encoding Detection of HTML Documents</b></br>
 <em><b>A Practical Experience</b></em></br>
</p>

which was presented in the *[11th Asia Information Retrieval Societies Conference][1]*, in *Brisbane*, *Australia*, *2015*.

Although we wrote a paper to describe the algorithm, but this tool is not just an academic effort to solve *charset encoding detection* problem for HTML web pages. In fact this tool is an **industrial** product which is actively used in a large-scale web crawler,  continuously under the load of over than **1 billion** web pages.

##Precision (quick view)

In order to determine the precision of IUST HTMLCharDet, we compared it with the two famous charset detector tools namely _**IBM ICU**_ and _**Mozilla CharDet**_ aginst two test scenario, i.e. **Encoding-Wise** and **Language-Wise**. Results of the comparisons are presented in the [*paper*][paper], but bellow you can have a glance at results. To read more about comparisons, please find the paper inside the *wiki* folder.

**Note:** In these images *Hybrid* is the same *IUST HTMLCharDet*, in the paper we called it *Hybrid* because it is actually a hybrid mechanism.

####Encoding-Wise
In this test scenario, we compared *IBM ICU*Ùˆ *Mozilla CharDet* and the *hybrid mechanism* against a corpus of HTML Documents. To create this corpus, we wrote a multi-threaded crawler and then we gathered a collection of nearly 2700 HTML pages with various charset encoding types. The code which we wrote for creating this corpus is available in the [*corpus*][corpus] folder of this repository. Bellow find the comparison result ...

####Language-Wise
In this test scenario, we compared our hybrid mechanism with the two others from language point of view. In this connection, We collected a list of URLs that are pointing to various web pages with different languages. The URLs are selected from the **top one million websites** visited from all over the world, as reported by [*Alexa*][Alexa]. In order to collect HTML documents in a specific language, we investigated web pages with the internet domain name of that language. For example, *Japanese* web pages are collected from *.jp* domain. The results of evaluation for eight different languages are shown in details in following table ...
