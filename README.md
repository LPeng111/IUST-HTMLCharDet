#IUST HTMLCharDet

IUST HTMLCharDet is a java tool for detecting **charset encoding** of HTML web pages. **HTMLCharDet** stands for _**HTML** **Char**set **Dete**ctor_ and **IUST** stands for _**I**ran **U**niversity of **S**cience & **T**echnology_.

This tool is in connection with a paper entitled:  
<p align=center style="font-size:160%;">
 <b>Charset Encoding Detection of HTML Documents</b></br>
 <em><b>A Practical Experience</b></em></br>
</p>

which is presented in the *[11th Asia Information Retrieval Societies Conference][1]*, in *Brisbane*, *Queensland*, *Australia*, *2015*.

Though we wrote a paper to describe the algorithm, but this tool is not just an academic effort to solve *charset encoding detection* problem for the HTML web pages. In fact this tool is an **industrial** product which is actively used in a large-scale web crawler,  continuously under the load of over than **1 billion** web pages.
